# CMPM-163 Homework

Description:

Homework1_0_1 is a 3D scene that contains 3 objects: one wooden box with texture, one low-poly christmas tree with Phong shader with one light source, and one seahorse with customized color effect. You can rotate them by drag the mouse. 

Homework1_1 is an image process demo using emboss kernel. You can interact with it by moving the mouse from left to right or reversely.

Homework1_2_3 is the 3D version of ‘Game of Life’. The rule in fragment shader is similar to the original version with a little color adjustment. The background scene is rendered to framebuffer that is passed into shader. The main scene includes a cube and a sphere with framebuffer_A and framebuffer_B(render target) as materials respectively. Then the whole scene is rendered.
