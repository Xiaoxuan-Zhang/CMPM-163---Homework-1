Homework1_2_3 is the 3D version of ‘Game of Life’. The rule in fragment shader is similar to the original version with a little color adjustment. The background scene is rendered to framebuffer that is passed into shader. The main scene includes a cube and a sphere with framebuffer_A and framebuffer_B(render target) as materials respectively. Then the whole scene is rendered.
